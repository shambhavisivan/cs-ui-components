# Accessibility

## General<a name="General"></a>
* Slogan - Essential for some, useful for all.
  * Accessibility addresses discriminatory aspects related to an equivalent user experience for people with disabilities, including people with age-related impairments. For the web, accessibility means that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites and tools, and that they can contribute equally without barriers.
  * The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognizes access to information and communications technologies, including the Web, as a basic human right. As such, it is our duty to help provide that access.
  * There is also a strong business case for accessibility. Accessibility overlaps with other best practices such as mobile web design, device independence, multimodal interaction, usability, design for older users, and search engine optimization.

* The three conformance levels are:
  * A (lowest)
  * AA (mid-range)
  * AAA (highest)

* Salesforce and Cloudsense are aiming to meet conformance level of AA

* There are:
  * 30 Level A Success Criterions
  * 20 Level AA Success Criterions
  * 28 Level AAA Success Criterions

* What are distinctions between terms accessibility, usability, inclusion?

> Accessibility addresses discriminatory aspects related to an equivalent user experience for people with disabilities, including people with age-related impairments. For the web, accessibility means that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites and tools, and that they can contribute equally without barriers.

> Usability and user experience design is about designing products to be effective, efficient, and satisfying. Specifically, ISO defines usability as the â€œextent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals effectively, efficiently and with satisfaction in a specified context of use" (in ISO 9241-11).

> Inclusive design, universal design, and design for all involves designing products, such as websites, to be usable by everyone to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation. Inclusion addresses a broad range of issues including access to and quality of: hardware, software, and Internet connectivity; computer literacy and skills, economic situation, education;, geographic location, and language; as well as age and disability.
